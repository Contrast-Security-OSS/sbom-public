# GitHub Pages Output Directory

This directory contains the generated static site files that are served via GitHub Pages.

**Do not edit files in this directory manually** - they are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow.

The site is built from:
- `site/` - Source HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `sboms/` - Generated SBOM files (created during workflow)

The workflow runs daily and updates this directory automatically.
